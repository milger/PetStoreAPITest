# Pet Store Testing Practice

## Tasks


### 1. API test automation
Open `api-test-automation` folder. It contains a java project which include all tests scenarios for Pet service.
 
### 2. API performance test
The `api-performance` folder contains a sample nodejs project applying k6. It is only a simple overview about how I could apply k6 from a un-experienced performance player.
